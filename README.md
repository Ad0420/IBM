Work done as part of IBM internship - "Heba changes"

Below is the set up process to prepare the Raspberry Pi 4 with the Raspbian operating system.

Equipment used:
- Raspberry Pi 4
- KIOXIA EXCERIA 16GB microSD HC card
- LADP1 KIOXIA flash microSD adapter

Raspberry Pi documentation used for setup:  Check out the website [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/).

Install operating system using imager, download latest version from [here](raspberrypi.com/software).

Once the setup was complete, a simple Python script was written to blink an LED connected to the Raspberry Pi. This can be found....

## Week 2: Sensor Integration and Data Processing

### Tasks

1. **Connect and read data from a temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20) using Python.**
2. **Implement a simple data processing script to calculate the average temperature over a set period.**
3. **Visualize the temperature data using a Python library like Matplotlib or Seaborn.**
